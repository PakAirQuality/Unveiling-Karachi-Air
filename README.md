### **ðŸ“„ Description**

This dataset accompanies the policy report "Unveiling Karachi's Air: A Scientific Foundation for a Clean Air City," published by the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI). It contains the foundational air quality monitoring data and the summary of environmental standards used in the report's analysis.

The abstract for the main report is as follows:
> Air pollution is a public health crisis in Karachi that shortens the life of an average resident by 2.7 years. On-the-ground monitoring reveals a city trapped in a cycle of hazardous air, with 363 out of 366 days in 2024 failing to meet the WHO's health-based guideline. On 70 of those days, pollution was so severe it also breached the legal limits set by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). To address this crisis, the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI) has developed the first comprehensive, scientific emissions inventory for Karachi. This report diagnoses the primary sources of this pollution, providing the indispensable evidence needed for effective action. The inventory, with a baseline year of 2021, quantifies a substantial pollution load, including 39.11 kilotons of health-damaging fine particulate matter (PM2.5) annually. Key findings pinpoint industrial activities as the largest source of PM2.5 (49%), while the transportation sector is the second-largest contributor (33%) and the overwhelming source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at 80%. Power generation and port operations are also identified as major polluters. More than a diagnosis, this report is a blueprint for action. It demonstrates that Karachi's air pollution is not an intractable issue but is local, measurable, and solvable. It identifies a suite of priority interventions in industry, transport, and port operations that, if fully implemented, could reduce urban PM2.5 emissions by up to 50%. This research provides the scientific foundation for policymakers, industry, and civil society to collaboratively forge a path toward a healthier, more sustainable Karachi.
